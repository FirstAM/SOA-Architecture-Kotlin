## SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)
SOA (Serviceâ€”oriented architecture) is an approach to building a system where application functionality is divided into independent, self-sufficient services.
Each service is responsible for a specific task or business process and interacts with others through standardized interfaces, most often using protocols like HTTP or messaging.

Example with three simple services 
- Order
- User
- TODO: Notification-Service
